## Project

One of the main pain point that Uber's team found is that sometimes drivers are not around when users need them. For example, a user might be in San Francisco's Financial District whereas Uber drivers are looking for customers in Castro.  

(If you are not familiar with the bay area, check out <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Francisco,+CA,+USA/@37.7515389,-122.4567213,13.43z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x80859a6d00690021:0x4a501367f076adff!8m2!3d37.7749295!4d-122.4194155" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>)

Eventhough both neighborhood are not that far away, users would still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes before being picked-up, which is too long. Uber's research shows that users accept to wait 5-7 minutes, otherwise they would cancel their ride. 

Therefore, Uber's data team would like to work on a project where **their app would recommend hot-zones in major cities to be in at any given time of day.**  

## Goals

Uber already has data about pickups in major cities. Your objective is to create algorithms that will determine where are the hot-zones that drivers should be in. Therefore you will:

* Create an algorithm to find hot zones 
* Visualize results on a nice dashboard
